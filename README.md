# API-StarWars-ITEA-final-project
Final HomeWork in the Future in IT_Web Developer_03_01\11 course from ITEA


Description of the task:
Task: make an API request to https://swapi.dev/ and display the following information:
Display a clickable list of all characters that will be returned after calling "/people". By default, 10 records will be returned, so it is necessary to implement "next" and, if necessary, "previous" buttons. For example, if I click "next" and scroll the list 10 records forward, I can return to the previous page by clicking the corresponding button.
When the character's name is clicked, fields with information about them should be displayed in the form of a table:
the name in the header;
birth year;
gender;
list (<ul>>) of movies;
homeworld;
species;
Add a "Back to List" button to return to the field from which the character details were accessed. This information can be "remembered" through browser storage.
Format the view on the client side so that it does not look garish. Add .css for the list, buttons, and lists; assemble the elements in such a way that there are no "holes" on the page, i.e., a full-fledged page with a pleasant interface. Consider the format for displaying information: how new elements will be hidden or displayed.
